# unofficial-searchgpt-api
To develop an alternative to SearchGPT that integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o model with web search capabilities, you can create a RESTful API using Python, Flask, and the OpenAI API. This setup will allow you to handle both GET and POST requests, process user queries, perform web searches, and generate AI-driven responses.
